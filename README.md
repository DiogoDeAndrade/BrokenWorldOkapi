# Broken World

This game is an improvement on the original [2020 Global Game Jam game].

I've created a separate repo so that anyone that wants to check the original version can do so without any interference.
Now I'm going to work on this as a submission to the Okapi Game Design Club this month (theme "Arcade"), since the game can work as such and I don't really have the time to build something else.

The objective of this game is to repair a world plagued by time-space distortions.

## Story

The Universe is collapsing from anomalies in space-time...
An intergalatic agency was formed, filled with agents that go into broken planets and repair the damage done using state of the art neutronic ionized backpacks. 
You're a student in your last exam, to be able to join the ranks of men and women that are responsible for saving the Universe... 

You are... 

Agent 123-A!

## Tech stuff

This is just a normal platformer game, so no really interesting tech stuff.
The only thing that is actually interesting is in the [UnityCommon] library: the [TimeScaler2d component], which causes objects to speed up/slow down in certain conditions. Check the github repo for it for some more technical details.
