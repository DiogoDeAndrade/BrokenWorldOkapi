# Broken World

This is a game done for the 2020 Global Game Jam, theme "Repair".

The objective of this game is to repair a world plagued by time-space distortions.

I couldn't manage to finish the game, so I only have the 8 levels of tutorial that kind of show everything the game eventually could have been...

In the future I might fork this and expand it for Okapi Game Development Club and complete it (not much left to do, from a technical standpoint, just some art and game design stuff!).

## Story

The Universe is collapsing from anomalies in space-time...
An intergalatic agency was formed, filled with agents that go into broken planets and repair the damage done using state of the art neutronic ionized backpacks. 
You're a student in your last exam, to be able to join the ranks of men and women that are responsible for saving the Universe... 

You are... 

Agent 123-A!

## Tech stuff

This is just a normal platformer game, so no really interesting tech stuff.
The only thing that is actually interesting is in the [UnityCommon] library: the [TimeScaler2d component], which causes objects to speed up/slow down in certain conditions. Check the github repo for it for some more technical details.
